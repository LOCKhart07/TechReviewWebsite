The 90dB give a deep, powerful, and crisp sound. The inner & outer rings deliver vibrant bass, vivid midst & vivacious highs without overlap.","Smart Bluetooth headset with built-in Mic Integrated with Alexa Voice Assistant Multiple playback options - Bluetooth, FM Radio, MicroSD and 3.5 mm AUX FM Radio built in with clear reception of your favourite channels SD card function allows you to carry 1000’s of songs on the go","Long-lasting battery: Powerful, chargeable battery lets you enjoy up to 10 hours of playtime and 200hrs of standby on a single charge - from your morning exercise to evening lounging.

Superior audio quality: Enjoy high-quality music, and never miss another beat with clear treble, mids, and a harder bass.The inbuilt, custom-tuned drivers of 40 mm give solid bass effect and amazing treble too making you feel you are in a live theatrical performance.","If you are looking for a pair of wireless headphones that don’t burn through your pocket, the Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC headphones could be what you’re looking for. They offer decent noise cancellation that justifies the price. They may not be as powerful as the Sony WH-1000XM3 or sound as great as the Amiron, but these Sennheiser headphones offer good value for money","Audio-Technica has a rich history when it comes to class-leading high-end audio products. The ATH-M50xBT carry that legacy forward while cutting the cord, delivering studio-quality audio experience sans the wires. The ATH-M50xBTs are designed for really high-end audio performance, with 45mm drivers and a frequency response range of 15-28,00 Hz, and it shows - we were very impressed with the warm, well-rounded sound. The ATH-M50xBT headphones also performed well in terms of battery life and Bluetooth connectivity. The one area where they aren’t up to snuff is the microphone – it is not strong enough and you may end up struggling to make phone calls with them. That said, these are studio-grade headphones and you’d probably not buy them for phone calls, so they are still great when it comes to their primary task.","If you travel a lot and want something that can last really long and block out all the external noise, then let us introduce you to the Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2. These headphones are one of the few ones on the market that can do all of the above and still cost a fraction of what headphones from big players like Sony, Bose and Beats cost. To maximise battery life, Plantronics has added a special feature that turns these headphones off when you are not wearing them. To make it simple, the Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2 offer great battery life, sound good, have great noise cancellation on offer and carry an affordable price tag.","One of the most affordable noise-cancelling headphones in the market. The Sony WH-CH710N is priced under Rs 10,000. Instead of the conventional active noise cancelling technique, these offer noise cancellation using Artificial Intelligent (AINC). Sony claims 35-hour battery life with noise cancellation but, in our testing, we could get even more. It also offers a quick charge via Type-C port. For connectivity, there is Bluetooth 5.0 and also NFC. The mids and lows are on the lower frequencies. Overall, I felt that they sounded flat more often than not. However, the loud music makes it up in many cases. The dual-microphone does a pretty decent job here. These are worth considering if you’re looking for a headphone with noise cancellation under Rs 10,000.","Last on the list is the most affordable headphones on too. Boat is one of the most popular brands in India which makes accessories like headphones, earphones, Bluetooth speakers, and much more. The Boat Rockerz 600 headphones are quite popular with youngsters and the two main reasons being - affordable price and powerful punchy bass. The Boat Rockerz 600 features 40 mm drivers to produce punchy bass and can last up to 8 hours on a single charge, which is good for the price. It features soft earcups for a comfortable fit but, the fit may be too tight for some people. Apart from that, they are very easy to carry around as they come with foldable design. Overall materials used is also quite good and overall sound quality is pretty much good. The headphones are more suited for people who prefer bass. "]

You also get good battery backup. However, the most impressive aspect about this phone is the camera department. The handset offers cameras that can take detailed pictures that can rival those taken from most other premium end smartphones. If you have used MIUI before, you'll feel right at home but with an even less intrusive interface.","Huawei P30 Pro turned out to be the unlikely contender that displaced iPhone XS Max from the top spot in this list. The new handset from Huawei comes with incredible features like 50x zoom, reverse charging, and excellent low-light imaging capabilities. Arguably the best-looking smartphone in the market, the P30 Pro comes with a quad-camera setup that allows it to produce pictures that can, at times, rival DSLR cameras as well. Huawei’s P30 Pro is the best Android handset to come in a very long time and offers good performance on all fronts.","OnePlus has the habit of launching flagship-killer phones and although the brand is itself getting good competition off-late, there is no denying that its latest offering, i.e. OnePlus 7T, is one of the best handsets to launch in 2019. When you consider that OnePlus 7T comes with a 90Hz display, 30W fast charging, the top-of-the-line chipset, and a premium design, at a much lower price point than most flagships, you'll have to ponder over the thought of spending a premium for other handsets in the market and the additional value they bring along.","When a handset offers the top-of-the-line chipset available in the market for half the price of most flagships, there is little room left for nitpicking. Realme X2 Pro doesn't just feature a great processor but offers an extremely capable camera setup, headlined by a whopping 64MP camera sensor. The top features don't end here as the flagship from Realme comes with a 90Hz display, which provides a butter-smooth user experience. It won't be wrong to say that Realme has gained the reputation of new flagship killer in the market with Realme X2 Pro.","After launching OnePlus X with underwhelming specifications and getting a lower-than-usual response from customers, the brand definitely learnt its lesson. OnePlus Nord is one of the best mid-range smartphones available in the market and offers an experience that you would usually expect from a flagship. While the brand is not offering the best chipset in the market with the Nord, everything else seems to be on point. You get good camera performance, decent battery life, high refresh display, and a UI that makes everything work smoothly."]

It offers thumping and loud audio without distortion at high volumes; is light enough to carry on a camping trip but remains durable enough to tumble in a bag unprotected. There are certainly more detailed speakers out there (see: Bowers and Wilkins Zeppelin down below), but at a price that's relatively affordable to all, the UE Boom 3 hits all the right notes for the third year in a row.","JBL is a very well-known name when it comes to audio accessories, and the company maintains its reputation with the Charge 3. As a package, the JBL Charge 3 offers a compelling set of features and excellent sound quality to boot. It punches well above its weight, playing it loud and distortion-free.The Charge line of speakers have been on our shortlist of recommendations for a long time and the latest iteration maintains JBL’s dominance in the portable Bluetooth speaker market.","The Bose SoundLink Mini II is more than four years old now, making it ancient by modern standards of consumer electronics.

It might seem a bit pricey, but the audio performance and the retro looks are worth it.","As the name suggests, the JBL Flip 4 is an outdoor-friendly, rough-and-tough speaker that lets you focus on enjoying your moments without worrying about the speaker.While its easy to carry the Flip 4 around without worrying too much, its sound quality isn’t really up to scratch, all things considered.","boAt is another well-known name when it comes to accessories.

Its rugged design and water resistance mean you can be carefree and live in the moment without having to worry about its safety.","The Sony Extra Bass SRS-XB10 is another tumbler design entry in this list.
